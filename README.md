Stub package for the VRChat-whitelisted Final IK components. This package strips off everything that is not serialized, and only serves to preserve the serialized information in imported prefabs/scenes.

## How it works

By having the same GUID as original scripts, it makes the scripts automatically reference the stubs. By using the same variable names, the serialized information gets transferred properly.
